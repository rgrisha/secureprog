# Task 4. Applying SOLID principles #

You have very poorly written Turing Machine code in TuringMachine.java . It works, but is hard to maintain and change

Your task is to apply as much SOLID principles as possible - chop code into pieces to make every class single responsibility: head, rules, tape, etc.

You might use any object oriented language.

You have ```*.tmprog.txt``` or ```*.tmprog.json``` files to execute by TM. Best proof of SOLID would be to 
demonstrate Turing machine that reads ```*.tmprog.txt``` files and then change it to be able to 
execute ```*.tmprog.json``` files from URLs by downloading them, loading and executing. If you did the design of program correct, 
these changes should be quite minimal.
